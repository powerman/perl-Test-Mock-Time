# NAME

Test::Mock::Time - Deterministic time & timers for event loop tests

# VERSION

This document describes Test::Mock::Time version v0.1.7

# SYNOPSIS

    use Test::Mock::Time;

    # All these functions will return same constant time
    # until you manually move time forward by some deterministic
    # value by sleep(), ff() or doing one tick of your event loop.
    say time();
    say localtime();
    say gmtime();
    say Time::HiRes::time();
    say Time::HiRes::gettimeofday();
    say Time::HiRes::clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME());
    say Time::HiRes::clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC());

    # All these functions will fast-forward time (so time() etc.
    # will return increased value on next call) and return immediately.
    # Pending timers of your event loop (if any) will not be processed.
    sleep(1);
    Time::HiRes::sleep(0.5);
    Time::HiRes::usleep(500_000);
    Time::HiRes::nanosleep(500_000_000);
    Time::HiRes::clock_nanosleep(500_000_000);

    # This will fast-forward time and process pending timers (if any).
    ff(0.5);

    # These will call ff() in case no other (usually I/O) event happens in
    # $Test::Mock::Time::WAIT_ONE_TICK seconds of real time and there are
    # some active timers.
    Mojo::IOLoop->one_tick;
    EV::run(EV::RUN_ONCE);

# DESCRIPTION

This module replaces actual time with simulated time everywhere
(core time(), Time::HiRes, EV, AnyEvent with EV, Mojolicious, â€¦) and
provide a way to write deterministic tests for event loop based
applications with timers.

**IMPORTANT!** This module **must** be loaded by your script/app/test before
other related modules (Time::HiRes, Mojolicious, EV, etc.).

# EXPORTS

These functions are exported by default:

    ff

# INTERFACE

## WAIT\_ONE\_TICK

    $Test::Mock::Time::WAIT_ONE_TICK = 0.05;

This value is used to limit amount of real time spend waiting for
non-timer (usually I/O) event while one tick of event loop if there are
some active timers. In case no events happens while this time event loop
will be interrupted and time will be fast-forward to time when next timer
should expire by calling ff().

## ff

    ff( $seconds );
    ff();

Fast-forward current time by $seconds (can be fractional). All functions
like time() will returns previous value increased by $seconds after that.

Will run callbacks for pending timers of your event loop if they'll expire
while $seconds or if they've already expired (because you've used functions
like sleep() which fast-forward time without processing timers).

When called without params will fast-forward time by amount needed to run
callback for next pending timer (it may be 0 in case there are no pending
timers or if next pending timer already expired).
